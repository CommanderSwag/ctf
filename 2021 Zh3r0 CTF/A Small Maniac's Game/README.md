## Solution ##

This challenge contained a series of puzzles to be solved with assembly code. We were provided with 8 registers to store information and our goal was to move our jellyfish-like character to the stairs in each level. They started pretty basic, just moving the character up, down, left, or right. The difficulty gradually incleased until on the final level we had to determine which direction (left or right) to take our jellyfish based on whether a pseudo-random number is prime.
