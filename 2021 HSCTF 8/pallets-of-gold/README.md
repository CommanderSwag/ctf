## Problem ##

It doesn't really look like gold to me...

## Solution

We are faced an image that appears to be a random assortment of pixels:

<img src='pallets-of-gold.png' width=1000>

If we drop this image in [StegOnline](It doesn't really look like gold to me...) and then browse the bit planes, we have a pretty good view of the flag on the `Red 0` plane:

<img src='pallets-of-gold.png-red-0' width=1000>
