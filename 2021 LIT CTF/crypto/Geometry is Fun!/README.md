## Problem ##

We all love GEOMETRY, let's reminisce of all the times our teacher told us to find how large a certain figure is! Remember, Geometry teachers are bad at encrypting messages so the encryption method is not hard :D
(Note that the graphs may not be precise - only use angles/lengths notated in the diagrams)

## Solution ##

I was able to make short work of this problem via [Triangle Calculator](https://www.calculator.net/triangle-calculator.html).

Solving for the area of each triangle yields a list of numbers:

`9 12 15 22 5 7 5 15`

The cipher here is fairly clear, we just convert the numbers to letters according to their position in the alphabet. Doing so yields `ilovegeo`.

The flag is **flag{ilovegeo}**
