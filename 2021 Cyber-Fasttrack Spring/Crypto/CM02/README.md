# CM02
## BRIEFING
Download the file and find a way to get the flag.

Contents: cm02.txt

## Solution

The provided text file (`cm02.txt`) contains many smileys. I copy/pasted the text into a Word document and then used the find/replace-all tool to substitute different smileys one at a time for the letters from `a` to `z`.

After making all substitutions I ran the text through a substitution cipher which produced the result found in `decrypted.txt`. The flag was readily apparent.

The flag is **FREQUENTLY_SUBSTITUTE_FROWNY_FACE_FOR_SMILEY_FACE**.
